# EDA-Hotel_Booking_Analysis
I have analyzed a hotel booking dataset and drawn conclusions about the factors that influence the number of bookings, without using any personal information of the customers present in the dataset.
# Problem Statement
The dataset provided contains 119390 records, each with 32 features, that detail the bookings of two hotels, City Hotel and Resort Hotel, between July 2015 and August 2017. The primary goal is to analyze this dataset to identify the factors that impact hotel bookings. By examining the conclusions drawn from the analysis, any mistakes made by the hotel managers can be recognized and addressed to enhance hotel performance. This information can be used to help the hotels improve their overall bookings.
The data analysis aims to provide answers to the following questions:

#### Which hotel is preferred by travelers?
#### Which hotel has higher customer retention rates?
#### Which month has the highest booking activity?
#### Which room type is the most popular?
#### Which country has the highest number of bookings?
#### What is the average length of stay in the hotels?
#### How many bookings have been cancelled?
